# FizzBuzz
A very simple program, used for the game of FizzBuzz.

I was inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc&t=135s) video to try this small coding challenge.

It seemed like a small, interesting thing to code. So I gave it a shot.

# Rules
You and a friend decide on some range of numbers

Alternate reading out the numbers, BUT if the number is divisble by 3 then you say fizz, or if the number is divisble by 5 then you say buzz.

Finally, if the number is divisible by both you say fizzbuzz
